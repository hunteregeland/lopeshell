# lopeshell
This is the final project of the Operating Systems course (CST-315), where the development team needed to implement a full fake operating system &amp; shell. This included the design and engineering of a file manager, a virtual memory manager, a short-term processing scheduler, deadlock avoidance, and various system commands.

To run the shell, either cd to the directory and run:

  gcc -o shell main.cpp
  
 and then:
 
  ./shell
  
or just simply cd to the directory and run:
  
  ./shell
  
  
Enjoy!
